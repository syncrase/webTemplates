This is Striped, a fully responsive HTML5 site template designed by AJ/n33
and released for free by HTML5 Up! It features a clean, minimalistic design, styling 
for all basic page elements (including blockquotes, tables and lists), a repositionable 
sidebar (left or right), and HTML5/CSS3 code designed for quick and easy customization 
(see code comments for details). 

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)

PS: This site template is fully responsive, meaning it'll look great on desktop 
(widescreen and standard), tablet and mobile device displays. To see what this looks
like, just narrow down your browser window and hit "reload".
